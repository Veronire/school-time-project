# 🌍 European Capitals Quiz - My First C++ Project

## 📌 Description
This is a **C++ console-based quiz** designed to test knowledge of **European capitals**. It was my **first school project**, created as a **training tool before my geography exam in primary school**. The quiz asks multiple-choice questions and provides instant feedback on correctness.

## ✨ Features
- 🏛️ **14 Geography Questions** – Test your knowledge of European capitals.
- ✅ **Automatic Scoring System** – Gain or lose points based on your answers.
- 🔄 **Simple Console Interface** – User-friendly question-and-answer format.
- 🔢 **ASCII Input Validation** – Answers are checked using ASCII codes (`A=97, B=98, C=99`).
- 🎓 **Educational Purpose** – A fun way to prepare for geography tests!

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program **asks a geography question** with three possible answers (A, B, or C).
2. The user **selects an answer** by typing a letter.
3. If correct, the program **adds 1 point**; if incorrect, it **subtracts 1 point**.
4. The final score is displayed at the end.
